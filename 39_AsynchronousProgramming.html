    <h1>synchronous Programming:-</h1>
    <p>It means, the program statements executes in sequence. All other statements are blocked until first statement
        exrecutes.</p>
    <h1>Asynchronous programming:- (Ex:-settimeout,promises,async and wait) </h1>
    <p>It means , The program statements executes without blocking the flow of execution </p>

    <script>
        // 1. Synchronous Example:- It has blocking nature
        console.log("first statement.")
        var i;
        for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {            // Second statement executes when the loop complets execution
            console.log(i)
        }
        console.log("second statement.")


        // Asynchronous :- It doesn't have blocking nature.
        console.log("This is Asynchronous example.")

        // There is no blocking nature, settime out function executes after "1 second" in before that next statement will be execute.

        setTimeout(function () {
            console.log("This is inside the setTimeout Function")
        }, 1000)
        console.log("this is after the settimeout function.")
